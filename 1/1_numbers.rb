   Write a program which tells you:
   how many hours are in a year?
   how many minutes are in a decade?
   how many seconds old are you?
   how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life?
   Warning: This part of the program could take a while to compute!
   Here's a tougher question:
If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I?
