=begin
   Write a program which tells you:
   how many hours are in a year?
   how many minutes are in a decade?
   how many seconds old are you?
   how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life?
   Warning: This part of the program could take a while to compute!
   Here's a tougher question:
If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I?
=end


puts "so you wanna know stuff, eh?"
puts "Just look at this, man!"

puts "how many hours are in a year?   " + (365 * 24).to_s + " That's how many!"

puts "how many seconds old are you?  " + (365 * 24 * 39 * 3600).to_s  + " That's how many!"
puts "how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life?   " + " Too many!"
